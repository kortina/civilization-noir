<p>The accelerating pace of technological change and global connectivity has enabled a great deal of
progress, but has required increasingly complex systems for organizing modern civilization.</p>

<p>Neither technology itself nor the twentieth century institutions of media, finance, and
government seem to offer much hope for making sense of the inscrutable structures that dictate much
of our lives, so we're left searching for a modern folklore that can provide some form of
understanding and meaning.</p>

<p>Perhaps noir can offer us some clues as we face these dilemmas of modernity.</p>
